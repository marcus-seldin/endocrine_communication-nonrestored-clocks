Analyses were performed using the same approaches as defined in:
Seldin, M. M. et al. A Strategy for Discovery of Endocrine Interactions with Application to Whole-Body Metabolism. Cell Metab. 27, 1138-1155.e6 (2018).
Seldin, M. M. & Lusis, A. J. Systems-based approaches for investigation of inter-tissue communication. J. Lipid Res. 60, 450–455 (2019).


The mouse population data (HMDP) was generated in the following studies:
Parks, B. W. et al. Genetic control of obesity and gut microbiota composition in response to high-fat, high-sucrose diet in mice. Cell Metab. 17, 141–152 (2013).
Parks, B. W. et al. Genetic architecture of insulin resistance in the mouse. Cell Metab. 21, 334–347 (2015).

Circadian genes identified to be regulated by specific contexts are provided as "all_gene_list.txt"

All analyses were performed in R open source software, scripts are anotations and provided as "R-script for analysis.R"
